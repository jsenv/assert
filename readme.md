# assert [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@jsenv/assert.svg?logo=npm&label=package)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsenv/assert)

_@jsenv/assert_ is a NPM package used to write assertion during tests. It compare two values with extreme accuracy. If values differs, an error is thrown with a readable message. It helps you to know if the _actual_ value produced in a test matches what you _expected_.

```js
import { assert } from "@jsenv/assert"

const actual = { foo: false }
const expected = { foo: true }
assert({ actual, expected })
```

```console
> node ./docs/demo.mjs

AssertionError: unequal values
--- found ---
false
--- expected ---
true
--- at ---
value.foo
```

# Philosophy

1 - Very strict comparison between _actual_ and _expected_:

It is designed like this to make test fails if something subtle changes. Any subtle change in code might break things relying on it. You need that level of precision by default.

2 - We recommend to use _assert_ to test everything:

_assert_ can be the only assertion used to write tests. It mostly prevents [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding).

> equal() is my favorite assertion. If the only available assertion in every test suite was equal(), almost every test suite in the world would be better for it.

Personally, I tend to use only _assert_ because having only on way of doing things make things easier for my brain. And I care more about this than saving lines of code in a test file.

That being said, there is a few other assertions than can be used:

- _assert.any_
- _assert.not_
- _assert.matchesRegExp_

They exists because they can be useful enough to potentially counterbalance the simplicity of using only one assertion.

# How it works

_assert_ does nothing when comparison is successfull but throws an error when comparison is failing.
To illustrates when a comparison fails, check the list of examples below

## Type failure

```js
import { assert } from "@jsenv/assert"

const actual = 10
const expected = "10"

try {
  assert({ actual, expected })
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message)
}
```

```console
AssertionError: unequal values
--- found ---
10
--- expected ---
"10"
--- at ---
value
```

## Prototype failure

```js
import { assert } from "@jsenv/assert"

const actual = new TypeError()
const expected = new Error()

try {
  assert({ actual, expected })
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message)
}
```

```console
AssertionError: unequal prototypes
--- prototype found ---
window.TypeError.prototype
--- prototype expected ---
window.Error.prototype
--- at ---
value[[Prototype]]
```

## Properties order failure

```js
import { assert } from "@jsenv/assert"

const actual = { foo: true, bar: true }
const expected = { bar: true, foo: true }

try {
  assert({ actual, expected })
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e.message)
}
```

```console
AssertionError: unexpected properties order
--- properties order found ---
"foo"
"bar"
--- properties order expected ---
"bar"
"foo"
--- at ---
value
```
